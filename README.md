# Doctor Jones
> After all, we should all respect [w3c/clreq](https://github.com/w3c/clreq)

`doctor-jones` is a tool set designed for formatting Chinese and Western mixed texts, based on [w3c/clreq](https://github.com/w3c/clreq) and other best practices.

`doctor-jones` includes:

* [ ] An `npm` package which takes a string and returns the formatted output (almost done)
* [ ] A `webpack` loader which formats your `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.vue` files (WIP)
* [ ] A ready-to-use website where you can paste some text and get the formatted output, aka. `doctor-jones-as-a-service`, or DJAAS (in plan)
* [ ] A `vscode` plugin and a `WebStorm` plugin which format your code on save (in plan)

Currently this project is still in a very early stage.
